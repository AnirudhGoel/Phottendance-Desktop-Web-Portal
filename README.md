# Phottendance Desktop Web Portal
The Web Portal of my Hack@MSIT Hackathon Project-Phottendance (Photo + Attendance).

Phottendance is an image recognition based attendance marking app which was developed by me and Yogeshwar Dan Charan (https://github.com/charany1) in Hack@MSIT Hackathon.

* **How does the app work ?**

> The faculty just needs to click a picture of the class. REST ALL IS HANDLED BY APP.
The app will automatically recognise the faces of students present in the class (using Project-Oxford's API). This data is then transferred to a Database. The students or facutly can view the attendace anytime by visiting the desktop web portal of app.

I developed this desktop web portal using **Firebase Database**. This portal will automatically retrieve and show any new information that is added to the Database.

The data retrieving is done using **JavaScript** and the designing of the webpage is done by using **Bootstrap CSS**.
